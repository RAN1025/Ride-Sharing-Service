# Django Web-App: Ride Sharing Service
This web-app will let users request, drive for, and join rides. All the required functionalities have been implemented.

## Usage
git clone `https://github.com/RAN1025/Ride-Sharing-Service.git`       
cd `docker-deploy`      
cd `web-app`        
sudo `chmod o+x *.sh`       
cd `..`         
sudo `docker-compose up`        
           
Then, this web-app would be listening on port 8000.        


PS.        
We designed UI for it (reference: https://getbootstrap.com).
